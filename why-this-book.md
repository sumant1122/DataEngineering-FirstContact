# Why this book

Many data engineers often misunderstand the full scope of their roles. They tend to believe that data engineering is solely about managing and organizing vast quantities of data. However, the reality is much more complex and multifaceted. Data engineering extends beyond simple data management; it also involves ensuring that the data is accessible, secure, and usable for other professionals such as data scientists and analysts.

This accessibility is not just about providing access but also about making sure the data is in a usable format, structured appropriately, and free of errors or inconsistencies. This task involves understanding and implementing the end-to-end data pipeline, which includes various stages such as data ingestion, cleansing, transformation, and storage.

Understanding these processes and how they interconnect is a critical part of a data engineer's job. It's not just about handling data; it's about preparing it for use, ensuring its quality, and maintaining its security at all times. Therefore, the role of a data engineer is a crucial one that requires a deep understanding of data and its lifecycle.
